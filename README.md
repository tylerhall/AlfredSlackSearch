=================

This is an [Alfred.app](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow that searches your organization's [Slack](https://slack.com/) chat history. Just type `slack` followed by your query to search all of your channels. Pressing `return` on a result will open the result in your web browser.

## Setup

You'll need to edit the workflow and add your own Slack authentication token. You can [generate a token here](https://api.slack.com/). Paste your generated token into the line that looks like this...

    $token = 'xoxp-16253-23648123-2379487234-239876478';
